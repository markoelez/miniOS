#### Overview

Goal: write a simple operating system in as few lines as possible.

#### Features
- Custom bootloader (earlier commits, switched over to multiboot/GRUB to focus on the kernel)

#### TODO
- Shell
- Memory Management (malloc, paging, segmentation)
- GUI (graphics, window systems, event handling)
- File System (in-memory or disk)
- Process Management (process/thread scheduler, context switching)
- User Mode (syscall, kernel/user mode)
- Networking (TCP/IP stack, HTTP)
